## Agenda

1. To discuss ABDM Sdbx and HIF v0.6 spec divergence


## Attendees

AS, BK, KA, NS, SP

## Minutes

1. Terminology

	1. Currently, "Health ID" is being used for "abc@xyz" and "Health ID number" is being used for number associated with it
	2. "Consent manager ID" is being used in the docs to refer to "abc@xyz"
	3. "PHR ID" nowhere used in the sdbx docs
	4. **Eventually, "abc@xyz" will be called "PHR Address" and "Health ID" will refer to a number**
	
2. PHR Address versus Health ID

	1. **PHR Address = "abc@xyz", Health ID = number**
	2. Health ID will be unique to an individual
	3. Health ID will be required only if KYC is needed
  	4. Purpose similar to Aadhar authentication but domain limited to health

3. ABDM sdbx changes vis-a-vis HIF spec 

	1. The spec defines "CM" as the entity communicating with the end-user
	2. The current implementation defines an "HIE-CM" (Health Information Exchange - Consent Manager) that is run by ABDM (so in some sense is fused with the Gateway)
	3. The decision to let private licensed players run their own "HIE-CMs" is on the horizon
	4. In the current scope of implementation, multiple private (and one government) players are implementing applications that act as "CM-frontends" and not CMs, an entity nowhere defined in the spec
	5. It is foreseeable that almost all entities building "CM-frontends" will also act as HIUs and possibly even Health Lockers
	
3. Guidelines

	1. The spec that those building HIE-CMs are working with is [this](https://sandbox.abdm.gov.in/swagger/ndhm-phr-app.yaml)
	2. The ability to generate an app-agnostic "consent pin", revoke consent, create subscriptions etc. is provided via this API to "CM-frontends" who communicate with the HIE-CM
	3. This API definition is entirely beyond the HIF spec and not standardised, and it is not desirable that this be standardised (since a private HIE-CM may choose to implement this separately with other CM-frontends)
  	4. Risks? 
	    1. Is the absence of guidelines (including over the ability by CM-frontends to view event meta-data etc.) creating a risk for data misuse
	    2. Are "CM-frontends" that are also HIUs and simultanesouly also provide other services going to be able to be benefit from a user's health meta-data to promote/advertise other services they provide
	    3. "Purpose-limitation" requires more thought
	    4. A guideline document for "CM-frontends" may be written if concrete risks can be identified
	    5. This guidline document can be made part of policy if so
