## Agenda

1. To present: BK: Booking Flow


## Attendees

BK, NS, SP, SS, VV

## Minutes

1. Walkthrough existing Booking flow
	1. Goal is to create a session-less flow for a tele-medicine consultation booking, including consent sharing and data upload
	
2. "Provide PHR" step
	1. ”x@cm-id” be called CM ID for clarity (There is some confusion on the terms “PHR ID” or “Health ID” in the ABDM ecosystem) whereas “CM” is standardised and accepted by the joint parliamentary committee
	2. While booking, the requirement of this CM ID itself should be optional - a user on the patient app must necessarily opt-in, and the option to create consultations without a CM ID must be provided
	3. The “CM authentication” step during the booking is necessary to verify the identity of the patient, since an incorrect CM ID might mean data being shared with the incorrect individual
	4. The Patient app should be able to save authenticated CM IDs so that the "CM authentication" step is a one-time exercise and not a requirement for each consultation booking
	
3. "Consent request" step
	1. The consent request is automatically generated by the doctor's app upon notification of a final booking
	2. In case of a subscription request being approved, it is the responsibility of the CM to notify all Data Consumers of new data generation events belonging to the scope of the consent. Thus, post consent approval, all new data (say uploaded by an external facility) belonging to the scope of the consent should flow to the Doctor app

4. "Optional: Data upload" step
	1. A vast majority of initial consultation bookings are likely to have patient-uploaded data
		1. Scanned images of physical documents
		2. Digital documents present in the patient's devices 	 
	2. The optional redirection to a Health Locker app is intended for two reasons:
		1. Isolate the data upload to a separate entity allowing the patient app to be ignorant
		2. Allowing the seeding of health information into digital and secure health lockers
	3. This redirection and registration on a separate app may introduce friction and confusion
	4. Instead, data upload may occur via a URI generated by the doctor's app upon receipt of the consent request approval
		1. This URI may be displayed via a web browser-redirect or an in-app intent
	5. Post consultation, the doctor's app may share this health information along with the generated ePrescription to a requesting HIU 

5. The current flow must be updated to add:
	1. User expectations along each step, to make explicit what the user is to expect at each step

6. The consultation and post-consultation flows should be discussed in the next meeting
