## Minutes

1. Longitudinal storage of an individual's health record

	1. The merit in permanent health record storage
	   1.  Gene sequencing might become as routine as a heamoglobin test; PHRs created today might still be around 100 years later
	   2.  There is no debate that educational records should be stored for the lifetime of the individual
	   
   2. How will this permanent storage operationally play out?
      1. "Patient HIUs" - a class of HIUs charged with maintaining longitudinal records for patients
      2. Companies will come/go - so regulatorily requirement for migration if your company winds up
      3. The idea of "storage subsidy" which then creates the obligation of an "orderly shutdown" if the company shuts down
      4. It will be trivial to hand over data back to the client if the organisation shuts down - so the consequences of shutdown need not be overthought

   3. What happens to the HRP 
      1. HRP was a temporary creation to solve a gap - need not be wedded to any temporary solution, should be able to rethink from first principles

2. Avoid by-design: mapper between PHRs and Aadhar 
    1. It is an enormous overreach for the government to have the ability to know all of a citizen's health information
    2. Many PHR Addresses must not be able to be mapped to Aadhar - the use of the "Health ID" terminology should be dropped 
	
2. National policy on PHR opt-in or opt-out
   1. The Australia path: Any individual that interacts with the health system will have their data made available through the PHR network
   2. The other option: Joining the PHR network is optional, and even digital prescriptions can just be shared individually to patients
   3. In India, the majority of doctor-patient interactions will be physical, and trying to force a digitisation mandate on physical interactions is not likely to succeed
   4. Individual providers might continue to offer digital prescriptions which might not be of the PHR network, and the hope is that a doctor-led push eventually happens towards UHI
   5. The government is an enabler, not the provider (operationally UHI will be implemented via the Decentralised Health Protocol)

3. Ignorant EUA?

	1. The goal with an ignorant EUA is to enable a session-less EUA that works with the limited knowledge of a PHR address
  2. No desire to enforce the outcome of an end-user agent not being to store or retain a patient's health information
