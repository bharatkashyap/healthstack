## Agenda

1. To discuss Consultation and Post Consultation flows


## Attendees

BK, AT

## Minutes

1. Where should the meta information for a provisional transaction be stored?
  1. The current thinking is that this should be present in the individual's PHR to enable a session-less transaction
  2. I should be able to start a transaction in one client (Patient app) and complete it in another
  3. A contrary thought is that since the patient apps are DHP consumers, this information should be persisted by DHP gateways 

2. A pull request may be made to DHP specs repo to add the data fulfilment schema to the existing specification

3. Bilateral, duplex consents (allowing two-way read and write) don't exist yet; seem technically infeasible and incompatible with the idea of the consent as envisaged within DEPA
  1. Two separate consent artefacts should necessary have to be generated in this case 

3. The proposed changes to the ABDM specification should be verified/agreed upon with the NHA

4. The requirement is of an API documentation that is presentable to partner developers with a supporting sandbox behind it
  1. The Whimsical document has links to all APIs mentioned in the diagram  


## Next steps

1. (BK) Propose a path for meta information storage for provisional transactions

2. (BK) Review proposed changes to the ABDM specification with the relevant folks

3. (BK) Create a pull request to DHP with the data-related changes

4. (AT) Go through the ABDM APIs linked in the Whimsical document
