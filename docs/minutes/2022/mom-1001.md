## Attendees

BK, NS, SP, SS, VV

## Minutes

1. Recap of the existing [booking flow](https://whimsical.com/booking-document-upload-DBZHqEf2Pube4V6AMyzhUV)

2. The in and post consultation flow 
    1. There is a requirement for the option of a doctor to request for additional documents during the consultation - via the established consented channels
    2. What is the PHR app?
       1. The CM interface + Health Records app = PHR app, as is going forward in the 26 January NHA launch
       2. The ability for CM frontends to also store health records may be dangerous without technological safeguards 
     3. What happens to Ignorant EUA?
        1. From the current understanding, the Patient app should be able to store patient prescriptions - the ignorant EUA concept does not stand in the way of that idea

## Next steps

1. [ ] Discuss the DHP spec with AT and discover any convergence + work that may be needed to align PHR with it
2. [ ] Discuss with UHI - TM team
3. [x] Update the flow to include in-consultation data sharing
