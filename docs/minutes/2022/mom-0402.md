## Agenda

1. To discuss Consultation and Post Consultation flows


## Attendees

BK, SP

## Minutes

1. The URI protocol scheme should be “phr://”...
2. URI protocol scheme is acceptable to be used by third-party systems (patient apps) as well, but APIs to verify consent status etc. should be behind authentication
3. Two consent artefacts are necessarily needed to enable the dual behaviour of both the Doctor app and Health record app
   1. This may be enabled via a global subscription for the Health records app on sign up
4. The patient app may well be a web app (or a chatbot and so on), so as to enable easy initiation into the flow

# Next Steps
1. Address questions posed by UHI-TM:
   1. Assisted onboarding of PHR by ASHA worker (mechanism) 
   2. Dual consent collection (Read and write)
   3. Permanent storage of ePrescription (with patient)
   4. PHR App/ CM as a Look up ledger for appt and prescription details

2. Discuss the proposed changes needed to PHR spec to enable Health Record app initiated subscription requests without linking
